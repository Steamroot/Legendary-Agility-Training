My dog of a lifetime. Epic had his first Agility Dog Championship before he turned 3 years old. He got all his starters title in one weekend and got his Championship in less than a year of when he first began competing. At 3 years old he earned his first Bye into semifinals at USDAA nationals. At 4 years old he came in Second place at the South East Regional Championships. He also earned another bye into nationals that year. He went on to earn another bye the following year making him a 3-time USDAA National semifinalist. When he was 8 years old, he attended AKC Nationals in Reno Nevada. Epic can do all kinds of dog sports. At 9 years old he earned his first herding title in one weekend. at 11 he earned a dock diving title and he is one leg away from his first Obedience title. At almost 12 years old he is now working in Scent Work and hopefully soon will earn titles in that sport. He has 7 kids and they all hold titles in Dog sports. Four of them earning Championships in Obedience, Herding and Agility.</p>

His last National event he missed finals by just a few dogs. Sadly, we both have had injures which has kept us out of big events during our career.

                        <p class="dogs__text"><u><b>Legendary's Living Legacy AAD NA FD</b></u><br>Legacy is my youngest dog. We have only been running together for about a year. I see big things in store for this little girl. She is by far the most efficient dog I have run in the sport and her natural speed, grace and ability to make tight turns is going to take her a long way. I had to put off her training last year after I suffered from an Achilles rupture and meniscus tears in both knees. Getting back on track now and excited to get back out with her soon and start furthering our career together. We have just gotten into the Master level and hope to start working on qualifying for some Regional and National events.</p>

                            Elizabeth started to actively participate in agility since 1993 with her Border Collie Mix, Max. She has worked and studied under some of the best trainers in the world to achieve her education in the sport of agility and can work with any breed of dog and handler team to give them the highest quality of training. Elizabeth also stays up with the top methods being used as agility evolves into the highly competitive sport it is today. She can help you work toward getting to national level or just to have fun with your dog. Elizabeth has written articles for Clean Run and USDAA.com on agility related topics. Elizabeth knows and has competed in almost all the agility venues and can help your team understand the rules of the game. Elizabeth's Agility Philosophies: "I believe for a team to be the utmost success, there needs to be respect on both sides. I believe the handler not only needs to be very valuable to the dog, but the dog also understands their value to the handler. I also believe agility is a two-part sport, dog and handler’s. It is our job to make sure the dog understands his job completely, so I am a big proponent on teaching skills. Only then is the handler free to do their job. The dogs job includes contact criteria and independent contact performance, fully understanding how to weave no matter where the handler is on the course and independent weave poles, a solid start line and lead outs from the table and other areas and understanding the lines presented to the dog. Only then is the handler free to do their job which is showing the dog the lines, using lateral motion to move up the line ahead of the dog and tightening up turns. It is not about being faster than the dog, it is about working smarter as a team. I look forward to all the new opportunities teaching new people how to use these skills to create their own super team."
